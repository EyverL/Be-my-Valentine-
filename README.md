# Be my Valentine?
I created this after being inspired by a tiktoker who created something similar.

Along with what I had already planned to do for Valentines Day 2024 with my gf,
I figured I could throw something nice like this together, knowing she will 
appreciate it!

Description:
A webpage link where in the center of the body there is a question.
That question being: "Be my Valentine?"
Right under that there is a cat gif and "Yes" and "No" buttons just under that waitng
for a reply from the user.

If the user attempts to press "No" the button will run away from the cursor.
Once "Yes" is pressed the user will then be redirected to a new page that contains
a celebratory phrase (LETS GOOO!!!) and another cat gif with a question asking if
she would like to go to Urth Cafe right under it.
